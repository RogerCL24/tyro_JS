# Greeting
First program with Javascript

- To print text in the console we only need to code the following command:
```javascript
console.log("Hi everyone")
```

- In order to execute it in the browser we create the [index.html](index.html) file:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>JS from scratch</title>
</head>
<body>
    
    <script src="js_file_path"></script>
</body>
</html>
```
> [!NOTE]
> In our case _js_file_path_ will be ``greeting.js``

- Finally, we write the path of the `.html` file at the search bar of the browser:

</p>

As you can see the message is printed out at the console of the DevTools.
